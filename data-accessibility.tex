\subsection*{Benefit-sharing Statement}

Benefits Generated: Benefits from this research accrue from the sharing of our data and results on public databases and the distribution of a novel and useful R package as described above.

\section*{Author Contributions}

The gscramble simulation approach grew from discussions between TJS and ECA\@.
ECA, RMG, MGD, and TJS wrote the R package, `gscramble.'   Simulations of bias due to RISPI and
of variance in admixture fractions due to physical linkage were conducted by ECA.
The empirical analyses using `gscramble' were conducted by MGD, RMG, TJS, and ECA with previously published data.
All authors contributed to writing and editing the manuscript.
