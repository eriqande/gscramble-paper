\section*{Author Contributions}

The gscramble simulation approach grew from discussions between TJS and ECA\@.
ECA, RMG, MGD, and TJS wrote the R package, `gscramble.'   Simulations of bias due to RISPI and
of variance in admixture fractions due to physical linkage were conducted by ECA.
The empirical analyses using `gscramble' were conducted
by MGD and RMG with data from TJS and by ECA with previously published data.  All authors contributed to writing and
editing the manuscript.
